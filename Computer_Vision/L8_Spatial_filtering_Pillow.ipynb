    "Filtering involves enhancing an image, for example, removing the noise from an image. Noise can be caused by a bad camera or bad image compression. The same factors that cause noise may lead to blurry images. We can apply filters to sharpen these images. Convolution is a standard way to filter an image. The filter is called the kernel and different kernels perform different tasks. In addition, Convolution is used for many of the most advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. We simply take the dot product of the kernel and an equally-sized portion of the image. We then shift the kernel and repeat."
